# Kanban Board with JWT Authentication

## Description
This is a full-stack Kanban board application enhanced with secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs provide a compact, URL-safe mechanism for encoding authentication data and verifying user identities, making it an ideal solution for scalable, secure applications. In this project, a pre-built Kanban board has been upgraded to include:

- **Secure Login:** A dedicated login page with form inputs for username and password.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** On successful login, a JWT is generated and stored securely in the client's local storage for authenticating subsequent API requests.
- **Robust Security Flow:** Invalid credentials trigger error messages, and expired sessions automatically redirect users back to the login page.
- **Seamless UI/UX:** After login, users access a fully interactive Kanban board where tasks are organized into columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Deployment Ready:** The application is configured to be deployed on Render, with all necessary settings for environment variables and database connections.

This project was developed as a challenge to integrate JWT authentication into an existing Kanban board application, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. Download the Starter Code:
Make sure to download and unzip the starter code files provided, then initialize your own repository using these files.

3. Install Dependencies:
Install all required packages by running: npm install

4. Configure Environment Variables:
In the server directory, create a .env file and add:
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

## Usage

Starting the Application:
Launch the application by running:
npm start
Or, if you use a development workflow with concurrently running server and client:
npm run dev

Access the Login Page:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port). The login page will prompt you for your username and password.

Authentication Flow:

    Valid Login: Enter valid credentials to generate a JWT, store it in local storage, and be redirected to the main Kanban board.

    Invalid Login: Incorrect credentials will trigger an error message.

    Session Management: Logging out clears the stored JWT and redirects to the login page. Additionally, after a period of inactivity, the session expires, and the user is prompted to log in again.
